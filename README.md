# Morning-Star-Weapons-Cache
Version 0.0.2<br>
<br>
This cyber weapons cache is a multitool. One that you should keep in your pocket at all times. All weapons provided are built from scratch and installed as a module. 

Version 0.0.2 introduces a new weapon called "dns-spoof"<br>
As of now, the dns-spoof module just lists the names of your available network interfaces. The plan is to implement ARP spoofing and gateway identification next.
<br><br>
Version 0.0.1 Alpha notes: <br>
The other tool is called "http-brute".<br>
<br>
http-brute will allow you to fully define your HTTP packets. From cookies to completely unique HTTP headers.<br>
The http-brute weapon also comes with a highly configurable permutation engine for brute force fuzzing.  The permuter allows you to define which chars to use in your brute force, the min and max lengths of the generated payload, the order that the digits of the string are incremented, and much more. <br>
<br>
To enhance the user experience and ease of use, the http-brute module also allows you to write your finds to a file, save your current configuration to a file for loading across program closes, and along with that http-brute allows you to configure the exact position in your HTTP packet to insert your incrementing payload while also allowing you to set the search conditions that determines if the software has "found" what you're looking for.<br>
<br>
This software was made as a means to reduce the amount of custom programming required for computer hacking.
